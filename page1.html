                <h5 class="card-title">Art or Tkns</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> (in Greek : Τεχνες ) or a set of processes for the manufacture of man is to influence the emotions and human intelligence or to convey a meaning or concept , created to be. It can also be said that art is the ability and skill to create beauty . One of the most important artistic disciplines is the visual arts " painting , drawing , sculpture , photography andHe mentioned " printing ", " theater and dance " performing arts , music , " poetry , story " literature , cinema and architecture . The word art in Sanskrit is a combination of the two words "su" meaning good and "male" or "male" meaning man and woman . In the Avestan language, "s" has become "e" and the word "hun" has been created, which in the Pahlavi or Middle Persian language has become a modern form of "art", which means a perfect and wise man. [ Citation needed ] inGreek art, Tkns (in Greek : Τεχνες ) It is said that the name incorrectly loans Tknaljy (in English : technology ) means " technology " in the English language is. [1]

                  The Encyclop .dia Britannica definesart as "the use of the ability and imagination to create beautiful works, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others."
                  
                  In a new classification based on the book Marketing Art Strategy by Mehdi Khademi, we can divide the definitions of art into two categories: functional and procedural. Functions state that art is designed to deliver a goal, and that something is art that can help its holder achieve the goal, and its job is to provide enjoyable aesthetic experiences. Proceduralists, on the other hand, say that something is a work of art made according to a suitable formula or process; No matter what the purpose of art, art can be functional at first but ultimately procedural.
                  
                  Manro Brisidi (1982) offers a functional definition of art:
                  
                  "A work of art is a combination of conditions that are able to show the aesthetic features of art in order to provide valuable aesthetic experiences."
                  
                  While functionalists attribute the value of art to its nature, the definition of proceduralists is purely descriptive and not evaluative. One of the proposed procedural definitions is Dickey's definition, which is an organizational definition. He sees the work of art primarily as a "work of art" and secondly as "a set of key aspects awarded by some candidates in recognition of those active in the art system."

                <h5 class="card-title">Visual Art</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The basics of visual arts have elements that include:

                  Point, line, surface, volume, form of "shape", color, light, texture, rhythm, movement of "space and time", composition of "composition", proportion, balance of "balance", contrast of "contrast"
                  
                  
                  Broadway Tower in Worcester , England , a classic example of a decorative structure .
                  The divisions of art are varied; One of them generally divides works of art into two categories: fine arts and applied arts :
                  
                  Applied arts: Useful arts are arts that first, their function and usefulness are important and the purpose of their creation was their application. Such as: car design , architecture , industrial design .
                  Fine arts: Fine arts are arts that have been created just because they are beautiful. In other words, "they were not created for anything else, but for themselves." Such as: painting , sculpture , music , dance .
                  The word art is used in Persian today in a different meaning from the past and most of it refers to the result of human creation in the field of fine arts. The meaning of this word today is equivalent to the word fine arts in English. Traditionally, fine art collections are divided into 7 categories:
                  
                  Music
                  Handicrafts : Sculpture , Glassmaking , and
                  Drawing arts: painting , calligraphy , photography and…
                  Literature : poetry , stories , plays , screenplays and prose
                  Architecture
                  Dance and dramatic movements
                  Performing arts : cinema , theater and و
                  Other examples of the division of the seven arts in the order of time of creation or development are:
                  
                  Painting
                  Visual Arts "Painting, Drawing, Sculpture, Photography and Printing"
                  Architecture
                  the literature
                  Music
                  Theater
                  the cinema
                  Common features of works of art are:
                  
                  Imagination is the most important factor in shaping a work of art
                  All works of art come from the emotion and feeling of the artist, not from his logical thinking.
                  Ambiguity and prism are the third common denominator of all works of art.
                  This aspect of the characteristics of works of art, in fact, results from the two previous characteristics that we have enumerated. This means that any phenomenon whose main constituent element is imagination and emotion, can certainly not have a frozen and one-dimensional meaning. That is why everyone stands up for works of art; It has a special reception and inference. Works of art can simply express true beauty or emotion. The effect that art has on the human soul is a profound, lasting and long-lasting change. As a result, whenever we want to make a lasting impact, we can use any of the arts to suit our needs. As this argument has been proven in psychology, the world is made up of a set of people, so if we want to influence a large number of people in the fastest way, we can use the tools of art. The art of music and the performing arts because throughThe sense of hearing and the sense of sight are quickly perceived, can be combined quickly, and on a global scale can have a profound, profound, lasting and lasting impact on societies.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Industrial Arts 
                  Industrial or traditional arts are delicate arts and crafts that have grown over the centuries, preserving their roots and traditions, or have undergone the stages of their formation, and represent the culture of a nation.
                  
                  Iranian traditional arts can be divided into the following groups:
                  
                  Poetry and literature
                  Music
                  Architecture and related arts
                  Traditional and ritual performances
                  Freelance industries
                  Fine Industries 
                  Industry and delicate industries are a scale for measuring the degree of spiritual development of a nation. In this world among the thousands of sensations that we become aware of under the influence of our five senses and how; There are some things we involuntarily like the most. Our souls and our hearts are fascinated by them without any practical or immediate benefit from them. For example, when we stand in front of a painting that shows the fruit of a craftsman's mental powers, we spend hours watching it and are overwhelmed with astonishment and surprise.
                  
                  Which includes all works of art except the above. Sacred art has always had two fundamental ends. The first is the beauty of the face of worship and the second is its guarding and protection. The second distinction of sacred art refers to the fact that Islam does not consider beauty to be merely desirable, but contemplates beauty with perfection. What is the source of scattered motifs and the scattering of minds is denied in the realm of Islamic art, hence any golden makeup or luxurious clothes are rejected in worship.
                  
                  According to Burkhart , religious rites are divine art. Because the form of manifestation and symbolism exists on a level of human forms and states in search of a way beyond all manifestations and beings. In Christianity, these rites of worship - such as the Lord's Supper and special Christian rites - include the sacred art, namely Christian architecture and iconography, which are among the most prominent manifestations of Christian art. Due to the intrinsic meaning of Islamic worship, and the art that beautifies it, in the Islamic world we see the grace and artistic reflection of religious customs, that is, apart from the concept of iconography in Christian worship, which is also considered an art. The term industrial arts is commonly used to describe the part of handicrafts that is more dependent on art than art..</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Michelangelo was a triple threat: A painter (the Sistine Ceiling), a sculptor (the David and Pietà) and architect (St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). Make that a quadruple threat since he also wrote poetry. Though he bounced between Florence, Bologna and Venice, his greatest commissions were for the Medici Popes (including Julian II and Leo X, among others) in Rome. Aside from the aforementioned Sistine Ceiling, St. Peter's Basilica and Pietà, there was his tomb for Pope Julian II (which includes his iconic carving of Moses) and the design for the Laurentian Library at at San Lorenzo's Church. Twenty years after painting the Sistine Ceiling, he returned to the Chapel to create one of the greatest frescoes of the Renaissance: The Last Judgment.

                    <p class="card-text">Remarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his rediscovery in the 19th century. Since then, he’s been recognized as one of art history’s most important figures, an artist capable of rendering works of uncanny beauty. Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera obscura—an early form of projector—and certainly the soft blur he employs appears to foreshadow photorealism. But the most important aspect of his work is how it represents light as a tangible substance.

                    <p class="card-text">Watteau (1684–1721) was arguably the greatest French painter of the 18th-century, a transitional figure between Baroque art and the Roccoco style that followed. He emphasized color and movement, structuring his compositions so that they almost resembled theater scenes, but it was the atmospheric quality of his work that would become highly influential for artists like J.M.W Turner and the Impressionists.
